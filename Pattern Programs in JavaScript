Explanation
Step 1: Input the Size of the Square
The program begins by asking the user to input the size of the square. The input is converted to an integer using parseInt().
Step 2: Outer Loop for Rows
The outer loop controls how many rows are printed. It runs from 1 to size.
Step 3: Inner Loop for Columns
The inner loop controls how many columns are printed in each row. It also runs from 1 to size.
Step 4: Conditional Printing of Stars and Spaces
Stars (*) are printed at the boundary of the square:
On the first row (i === 1),
On the last row (i === size),
On the first column (j === 1),
On the last column (j === size).
Spaces are printed inside the square to create the hollow effect.
For size = 5, the output will be:

*****
*   *
*   *
*   *
*****
For size = 4, the output will be:

To create a Left Triangular Star Pattern in JavaScript, you can follow these steps:

Start by defining a variable to store the desired number of rows for the pattern.
Implement a loop that iterates from 1 to the specified number of rows.
Within the loop, employ a nested loop to print the stars on each line. The number of stars on each line corresponds to the current row number.
Display the pattern by printing the stars on each line, separated by spaces or any desired delimiter.
By incorporating these steps into your JavaScript code, you can generate a beautiful Left Triangular Star Pattern.
let num = 5;
let pattern = "";    //pattern string
if (num > 1) {      //no star pattern for 0 or negative numbers.
    for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {    //first 'for loop' for horizontal lines
        for (let j = 1; j <= i; j++) {      //second 'for loop' to print star
            pattern += "* ";    //adding * to pattern string
        }
        pattern += "\n";    //new line after row completion
    }
    console.log(pattern);   //printing star to console
}
else {
    pattern = "Number must be greater than 1 to print star pattern.";
}

Pattern 2: Hollow Left Triangle

Pattern 3: Downward Left Triangle
The Downward Left Triangular Star Pattern involves printing a series of stars in a left-aligned triangular shape, but in a downward direction. As you progress through the pattern, the number of stars per line decreases incrementally, forming a reversed triangular structure.
