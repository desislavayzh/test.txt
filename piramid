let n = 5; // you can take input from prompt or change the value
let string = "";
// External loop

  // printing spaces
  for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
    string += " ";

  // printing star

We will construct a pyramid of star (*) pattern with the help of for loop and nested for loop in the demo provided downwards.

Code:

let n = 6;  
  
for (let p = 1; p <= n; p++) {  
  for (let q = 1; q <= n - p; q++) {  
    process.stdout.write(' ')  
  }  
    
  for (let m = 0; m < 2 * p - 1; m++) {  
    process.stdout.write('*')  
  }  
    
  console.log();  
}  
Explanation:

First of all, we have constructed a variable n and assigned it an integer value. This value represents a total number of rows.
We have constructed for loop which is utilized to iterate the total number of rows.
Then we have constructed a nested for loop that prints space n-p times. If p is 4 then it will print 3 spaces.
Then we have constructed another nested loop which is utilized to print stars (2 * p - 1) times. If value of p is 2 then it will print 3 stars.
Output:

Here is the output where we can witness that the pyramid of the star pattern is constructed using three for loops.

Demo 2:

We will construct an upper pyramid star pattern utilizing a single for loop.

Code:

function createPyramid(rows) {  
    let pyramid = '';  
    for (let k = 0; k < rows; k++) {  
        pyramid += ' '.repeat(rows - k - 1);  
        pyramid += '*'.repeat(2 * k + 1);  
        pyramid += '\n';  
    }  
    console.log(pyramid);  
}  
  
createPyramid(6);  
Explanation:

First of all, we have created a function called "createPyramid" which has a parameter called "rows".
Then under that function, we have declared a variable called "pyramid".
We have then constructed for loop to iterate each row.
for loop is utilized to first add spaces then adds star (*) and then breaks the line and moves to the next line.
Output:

Here in the output downwards we can witness that the pyramid star pattern is constructed with the assistance of a single loop.
